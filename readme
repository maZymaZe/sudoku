if you want to compile this on your computer,check the address of sfml
    setup by running the setup.bat
    (which includes " del /s "*.o" " pay attention!!)

or you can just
play by running the main.exe

1.if you can see the menu but crash when clicking the button,
that is something wrong with the "ifstream" in my code.

(1 is solved,please run the main-fopen.exe)(i use fopen here)

2. if it says libgcc_s_seh-1.dll is missing or 
unable to start correctly 0xc000007b
so sorry, i havn't know the reason and solution yet.
